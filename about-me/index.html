    <p>
        My name is David Louie and I'm from Queens, New York.  I graduated from Stony Brook University in the Fall 2014 semester with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics.  My interests include music, photography, basketball, and technology.  I play guitar, bass, and drums, I have a love/hate relationship with the Knicks (so I jumped ship and started watching the Clippers), and my interest in technology stemmed from an early adoption of Google's Android mobile OS.  I'm also currently a part of Dev Bootcamp's Squirrels 2015 cohort.

    </header>
    <p>
        As I mentioned, I graduated from Stony Brook University with a degree in Economics, but that's not even close to what I wanted to do when I first got to college.  I started school in Fall 2010 majoring in Computer Engineering, but I found that high school didn't prepare me for the challenges that college was going to throw at me.  I wasn't prepared for the late nights, the heavy workload, or the odd class hours.  Basically, I didn't know how to be a real student.  It took some time, a major change, and a whole lot of work, but I eventually figured it out and was able to graduate only a semester late.  The only problem was that I had no idea what I wanted to do with it all.  I spent a lot of time after I graduated applying to a bunch of retail jobs so I could make some money while I figured out what I wanted to do but with no luck.  With so much free time, I was able to think a lot about what I wanted to do, and I thought back to what interested me in college.  Throughout my time in school, I had always lived with someone who was a Computer Science major.  Whenever I would see them doing their work, I would always look at it and think, "What is that?  You're just typing words into a computer and things happen!"  I would ask them a ton of questions, and it all seemed really arcane to me.  When one of my roommates heard that I was having trouble figuring out what I wanted to do, he told me to check out Dev Bootcamp.  I took his advice, and I liked what I saw so I applied, and here I am.

        <h5 class="info-title"> Goals for After Dev Bootcamp:</h5>
    </header>
    <p>
        I'm still not entirely sure about what I want to do after my time at Dev Bootcamp is over, but what I do know is that I want to build some amazing things and I know that Dev Bootcamp is going to give me the tools to do that.  I'm really excited for all the things that Dev Bootcamp is going to teach me and what we can create together.
