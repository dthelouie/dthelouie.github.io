        This week we got to learn about Ruby and defining methods.  We had already gone over some of this when we were in Dev Bootcamp's interview process, but what we did this week definitely went a lot deeper than what we had done on Codecademy.  This week's challenges went over strings, integers, variables, arrays, hashes, and methods.  We also learned about refactoring with Ruby's built-in methods to make our code clean and concise.  One of the other things that we focused on this week was the difference between arrays and hashes, and that's what I'm going to be talking about today.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arrays and hashes are very similar elements in Ruby.  They are both indexed collections that can house other objects and information, such as strings, integers, variables, and even other arrays and hashes.  These objects are values that can be accessed by a key.  When working with arrays, these keys are integers.  Objects in an array are assigned their key based on their position inside the array.  With hashes, these keys can be any type of object.  Objects in a hash are assigned keys manually.  Although their keys may be different, they both produce a value when accessed.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an example of an array:
        <div class="post-pic"><img src="../imgs/array.png"/></div>
        Since objects in an array are accessed by the integer corresponding to their position in the array, we can call them individually like this:
        <div class="post-pic"><img src="../imgs/array-call.png"/></div>
        Using the interactive ruby shell, I set the variable my_info equal to an array, and called the object, "Fresh Meadows" with the name of the variable, and the position of the object in the array.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an example of a hash:
        <div class="post-pic"><img src="../imgs/hash.png"/></div>
        Hash values are accessed by their keys like this:
        <div class="post-pic"><img src="../imgs/hash-call.png"/></div>
        First, I set the variable my_info equal to a hash with keys and their corresponding values.  Then I called the key, and the corresponding value was returned.
    </p>
    <p>
        While they behave very similarly, arrays and hashes can be used for different things.  Arrays can be used when you have no need for custom key values, and hashes can be used when you want to map specific values to each other and gives you a lot more flexibility to customize your key values.
