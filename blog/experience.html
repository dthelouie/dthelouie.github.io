        It's really hard to believe that next week is the beginning of Phase 1 for the Squirrels cohort.  It seems like only yesterday I had no idea how to write any sort of code whatsoever, and now here I am with a decently functioning website, made 100% by myself.  Throughout Phase 0, I've learned a lot of different things.  I've learned about the Command Line Interface, Git, HTML, CSS, Ruby, JavaScript, and SQL.  Seems like a lot of information for just nine weeks, but it'll all be crucial during Phases 1, 2 and 3.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Possibly the most rewarding part of the whole experience so far has been this website.  It's a visual representation of all that we've learned, and a snapshot of what we're capable of creating.  It's been a challenging experience, but I'm grateful for every second, as it was a great learning experience.  I learned just how important each piece of the process is to the end goal.  Wireframing was probably the part I enjoyed the least, but it made the actual writing of HTML and CSS much easier because it gave me a visual example of what I needed to create.  I enjoyed writing CSS the most because of how much you can do with it.  Having that much control over the interface was kind of confusing because I often didn't know what directions I wanted to go in, but it was really interesting to see how different design choices would impact the look and feel of my page.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also learned that having a website takes a lot of maintenance.  Every time you add a page, you need to make sure that it links correctly to all of the appropriate pages.  It was kind of exhausting making changes to my navigation bar, or updating my home page because I'd have to make the same change in multiple places, and make sure that I didn't miss any spots.  It took a lot of time, but I guess that's just what it takes to have a page that needs to be updated when changes come.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, this has been a pretty rewarding experience.  Everything on my site seems to be working, links are directed to the correct places, and the dropdown menus that I put into my navigation bar are working perfectly.  I know a lot more than I did nine weeks ago, and I'm really excited for what Phase 1 has in store for us to learn.
