      This week we began Phase 0 as the Squirrels 2016 cohort with Dev Bootcamp and I couldn't be more excited.  Only a week and I feel like I've learned so much already!  We learned about the Command Line Interface, Version Control, Git, GitHub, and how to use them togeher so that we can be prepared for our work in the coming weeks.  Here's a little of what we learned about:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Version Control:</b>

            Version Control is a very important part of individual work as well as collaborative work in the world of programming.  It allows us to keep track of changes that occur in our work, and gives us the option to use it in case we run into issues with our current code.  With version control, we can maintain a stable version of what we're working on, as well as experimental code without affecting our main code with the help of branches. We can make different branches to see how different techniques or processes will run together and pick the one that works best.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Git:</b>

            Git helps us track changes by logging changes and storing each version of our updated work.  These versions are called "commits."  In each of these commits, we can see what has been added, removed or modified.  You can view the current version of the file as well as previous versions, each with commit messages with a short description of what has been changed since the previous version.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>GitHub:</b>
          
            GitHub is a great place to store code due to its accessibility and ease.  We can push our local repositories to GitHub straight from our terminals, and we can clone forked repositories to our computers.  It makes collaborative work easier by providing a central location to store and combine code rather than working on a single file that has to be passed around through a flash drive.  It also works as a place for you to allow others to look at your code for learning experiences and critique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this week, I thought these things were ridiculous and complicated, and for the most part, I was right.  But now that a little light has been shed upon them, everything is seeming a lot less arcane than it used to and I'm beginning to understand how useful these tools will be in our future as developers.
