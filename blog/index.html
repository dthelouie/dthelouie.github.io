        This week we got to have some more practice with Ruby.  We learned how to modify arrays and strings with methods, and store more complex information with hashes.  We also learned about object classes and how each class has specific methods that can be applied to them.  From there, we learned how to make our own classes and how to define methods that could be used for them.  Two of the methods I learned about were each, and map.

        This week we got to learn about Ruby and defining methods.  We had already gone over some of this when we were in Dev Bootcamp's interview process, but what we did this week definitely went a lot deeper than what we had done on Codecademy.  This week's challenges went over strings, integers, variables, arrays, hashes, and methods.  We also learned about refactoring with Ruby's built-in methods to make our code clean and concise.  One of the other things that we focused on this week was the difference between arrays and hashes, and that's what I'm going to be talking about today.

        Two more weeks with Dev Bootcamp, and we already have our own websites!  We've learned a lot about HTML and CSS and how to use them together to begin to create websites like the ones we see every day.  It's pretty awesome that we've gotten through so much material in such a short time.  I know we've barely scratched the surface, but to think that I didn't know any of this a couple weeks ago really excites me. We learned about a few different tools and concepts in CSS this week such as the difference between margins, borders and padding, different types of positioning, display properties, and how to use classes and ids.  I'm going to be talking about classes and ids.

        This week we began Phase 0 as the Squirrels 2016 cohort with Dev Bootcamp and I couldn't be more excited.  Only a week and I feel like I've learned so much already!  We learned about the Command Line Interface, Version Control, Git, GitHub, and how to use them togeher so that we can be prepared for our work in the coming weeks.
