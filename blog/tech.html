        The Internet is possibly one of the most useful tools in our lives.  We use it for many different things, such as learning, entertainment, and communication.  It's amazing to see how far we've come since landline phones, the postal service and televisions were the primary mediums of communication, or to know what's going on in the world.  It allows us instant access to information, and other people across the world, all on our computers or handheld devices, but how does it work?  That's what I'm going to discuss today.  
    </p>
    <p>
        What the Internet does is moves data from one place to another upon requests.  The Internet is a network of connected computers that relay this information.  It travels over different types of cables such as copper cables, which carries electrical signals, and fiber-optic cables which carry pulses of light from place to place.  These cables are connected to each network of computers one way or another, even underground and across oceans.  Data is moved through the processes of circuit switching and packet switching.  Circuit switching is a direct connection between computers through the telephone network.  This is how dial up worked.  Today, most data on the Internet moves through packet switching.  Data is broken up into smaller pieces called packets which are sent to a destination and is able to travel in different routes to that destination.  The packets arrive are put back together in order when they arrive at their destination.  Destinations are marked by Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and are labeled with World Wide Web addresses.  
    </p>
    <p>
        We are clients that are connected to the Internet through Internet Service Providers.  Commonly known as ISPs, they give us access to servers that contain the Web sites that we browse on.  They connect us to information that exists on these servers so that we can use them for our purposes.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Routers are also used to direct information to the right places.  As we send data to servers, routers help our data travel back and forth.  Routers are also used in many home and workplace settings to provide access to the Internet on what we call a Local Area Network.  Routers and ethernet switches give us connections to ISPs, which connect us to servers and other ISPs to connect us to each other.  This allows us to do everything that we do on the Internet today, such as streaming video content, checking the news or the weather, communicating with each other, social networking, and of course, it has allowed us to learn everything we've learned so far in Phase 0 with Dev Bootcamp.  None of this would have been possible without the Internet.
