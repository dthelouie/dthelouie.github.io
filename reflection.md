###1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

	I learned how each of these properties changes the positioning of the content inside of an element, and their position around other elements.  Margin helped change the element's position relative to other elements while padding defined the content's position relative to the end of the element.  The end of the element was marked by the border.

###2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?

	With position, you have to be aware of your element's margin, display, and position properties so that none of them conflict with each other and they're not fighting for the same space.  I had that issue a lot with my elements.  

###3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement?  What was most difficult?

	Changing the colors of links and elements was definitely the easiest technique to implement because I was able to look up the hexadecimal values of colors on the Internet.  Positioning was much harder because there were times when I wasn't totally aware of the effects that the positioning of certain elements were having on others and I would often have to use the Chrome devtools to see what was missing, what I didn't need, and what was causing the problems.

###4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

	I added a lot more semantic elements as well as IDs and classes to my HTML so my CSS work would be easier.  CSS gives us a greater control of what our websites and content will look like by giving us access to their sizes, shapes, and positions.  It'll be a very useful tool in the future.
